# Pattern 8 – Number Triangle (Continuous Increment)

This program prints a **number triangle** where the numbers increase continuously row by row.  
It uses nested loops:  
- Outer loop (`i`) controls the number of rows.  
- Inner loop (`j`) prints numbers in each row.  
- A counter variable `number` keeps track of the next number to print.  

---

## Code Explanation
- `n = 5` → Number of rows.  
- `number` starts at 1 and increments after every print.  
- Each row prints numbers in sequence, continuing from the last printed number.
