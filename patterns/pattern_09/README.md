# Pattern 9 – Binary Triangle Pattern (1s and 0s)

This Java program prints a **binary pattern** of `1`s and `0`s in a right-angled triangle form.  
The value at each position is determined by `(row + column)`:

- If `(row + column)` is **even** → print `1`
- If `(row + column)` is **odd** → print `0`
