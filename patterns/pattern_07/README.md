# Pattern 7 – Decreasing Number Triangle

This program prints a decreasing number triangle in Java.  
For each row, numbers start from `1` and go up to `n - i + 1`, where `i` is the current row.

---

## Code Explanation
- `n = 5` → number of rows.
- Outer loop (`i`) → runs from 1 to `n` (controls rows).
- Inner loop (`j`) → runs from 1 to `n - i + 1` (controls numbers in each row).
- Prints numbers in decreasing row length.
