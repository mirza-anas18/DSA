ðŸ§© Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey  

This repository tracks my journey of learning and practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms**.  
Iâ€™m solving problems topic-wise, documenting solutions, and building a strong foundation in problem-solving.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

The repo is organized into topic-wise folders for easy navigation:  

- **Patterns/** â†’ Basic programming patterns (loops, stars, numbers, etc.)  
- **Sorting/** â†’ Selection, Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.  
- **Arrays/** â†’ Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard problems  
- **Strings/** â†’ String manipulation, hashing, palindrome, etc.  
- **Recursion/** â†’ Classic recursion problems and backtracking  
- **Hashing/** â†’ HashMap/HashSet based problems  
- **LinkedList/** â†’ Single, Double, and problems  
- **Stacks & Queues/** â†’ Implementation + problems  
- **Trees/** â†’ Binary Tree, BST, traversal problems  
- **Graphs/** â†’ BFS, DFS, shortest path, cycle detection  
- **Dynamic Programming/** â†’ Classic DP problems

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  

- Build **strong DSA fundamentals**  
- Solve **topic-wise problems** (easy â†’ medium â†’ hard)  
- Consistently practice and track progress  
- Prepare for **coding interviews** (internships + placements)

## ðŸ“– Notes  

- Language used: **Java** (primary)  
- Some solutions may also be in **Python/C++** for cross-learning  
- Repository is updated **daily** as I practice
