# Find All Divisors of a Number in Java

This Java program finds and prints **all divisors of a given integer** using a `for` loop.  
A **divisor** of a number `n` is any integer `i` such that `n % i == 0`.

## ðŸ“Œ How it Works
1. Take input from the user using the `Scanner` class.  
2. Run a `for` loop from `1` to `n`.  
3. For each `i`, check if `n % i == 0`:  
   - If true â†’ `i` is a divisor, print it.  
4. End the loop after reaching `n`.
