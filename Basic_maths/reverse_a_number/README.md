# Reverse a Number in Java

This is a simple Java program that takes an integer input from the user and prints its reverse.

## ğŸ“Œ How it works
1. The user enters an integer.
2. The program extracts each digit from the number using the modulo operator (`%`).
3. It builds the reversed number step by step by multiplying the current reversed value by 10 and adding the last digit.
4. The process repeats until the number becomes 0.
5. The reversed number is displayed.
