Time Complexity: O(N) + O(X) + O(N-X) ~ O(2*N), where N = total no. of elements,
X = no. of non-zero elements, and N-X = total no. of zeros.
Reason: O(N) for copying non-zero elements from the original to the temporary array. O(X) for again copying it back from the temporary to the original array. O(N-X) for filling zeros in the original array. So, the total time complexity will be O(2*N).

Space Complexity: O(N), as we are using a temporary array to solve this problem and the maximum size of the array can be N in the worst case.
Reason: The temporary array stores the non-zero elements. In the worst case, all the given array elements will be non-zero.
