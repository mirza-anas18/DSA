# 🟢 Easy DSA Problems

This folder contains solutions to **Easy-level** Data Structures & Algorithms problems.  
For each problem, I’ve added both **Brute Force** and **Optimal** approaches (wherever possible).

## 📝 Notes
- Each file contains an explanation of the **logic** and its **time & space complexity**.  
- Brute solutions are written first for clarity, then optimized ones for efficiency.
