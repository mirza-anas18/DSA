# Linear Search in Java

This project demonstrates the **Linear Search** algorithm implemented in Java.  
Linear Search is the simplest searching technique where each element of the array is checked one by one until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm
1. Start from the first element in the array.  
2. Compare each element with the target value.  
3. If a match is found, return the index.  
4. If the entire array is traversed and no match is found, return `-1`.
